The robot arm consists of 2-Link which indicate its 2-dof itâ€™s RR. We will use Polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) which has 2.2 $g/cm^3$ density

For the motor we will use JX RD-B7640HV-180 40KG this motor Weight around 75g and can produce torque up to 40 $$kg*cm$$ and this motor Dual shaft in each side
